I recently started to be interested in programming :student:. My adventure with programming started in 2020, but then it was only by sheer curiosity. In 2021 I took programming seriously and started a really good Front-end course at udemy. Till this day I'm learning all the technologies required to became a good programmer and start working in a company.

### My other interests in the field of programming :man_scientist:	
I am a huge fan of watching YouTube films about programming, where can it be used, what are the technologies used in programming and a lot more! Recently I won a great book about JavaScript - "ÅšwiÄ™te Wojny Javascriptu" by BartÅ‚omiej Borowczyk and Jakub KrÃ³l, at a live broadcast at their YouTube channel. (I have already read the half of it :satisfied:). Besides that, I follow at LinkedIn and Facebook a lot of interesting personas, who are well known programmers around Poland and the World. Recently I started to try my CSS skills at [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/player/nFsQb3WsGwVyuUUxd94ipR3HzcY2), and did some great job! 

### What do I do besides programming :weight_lifting:	
I have been tutoring in mathematics for young people for a year, and I really like it. I go to the gym three times a week, because "Mens sana in corpore sano", what means, a healthy body makes a healthy mind :cartwheeling:.
